My neighbors just got a new puppy&hellip;yeah.

Usually I can fall asleep with a youtube video of noise and the video will die within a few hours due to my shitty internet connection.

That's not going to work anymore.

### Usage
git clone git@github.com:joshterrell805/sleep-noise.git
cd sleep-noise
npm install
sudo pacman -S sox
node test.njs

### TODO
I was really starting to like the rain sounds. Play around with this a bit and make a few cool sounds to sleep to.
